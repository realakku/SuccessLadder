Are you caught up in the day to day doldrums of your career?
<br>
The New Year is here. This means, it's a perfect time to complete the previous year and start fresh. If you haven't been passionate about your career in a while, capitalize on this time of the year to begin again.If you've lost your "get up and go," maybe what's missing is a new goal. Something that gets you excited and motivated again. Whether it's a new job or a new way of doing something in your present position, a new goal can give you something to look forward to.
<br>
So How Do Find A New Goal? Follow These Four Steps:
<br>
Convince Yourself That You Want A New Goal
<br>
No goal is achieved without commitment. Have you ever observed someone pursuing a goal and said to yourself, "That person is a true believer." True believers are easy to spot because they are defined by their commitment. Are you a true believer in your goal? Are you committed? If not, shift your perspective. Don't allow yourself to be comfortable with circumstances that do not further your goal.
<br>
Want to know that you will succeed before you step out of your comfort zone? Guess what? You don't get this guarantee up front. The miracles in your career happen when you say "yes" and jump in.
<br>
Start Small
<br>
Are you in one of these two places:
<br>
    You have no idea what should be the next step in your career,<br>
    You do know, but haven't done anything about it yet. 
<br>
Either way it doesn't matter. Now is your time to move forward.
<br>
Start small. Small steps increase your confidence and lead to completing other small steps. Small steps taken on a regular basis are more effective than larger steps taken inconsistently. Slow and steady wins the race.
<br>
Create Your Game Plan
<br>
Having a plan is vital to your success. With a plan, success is yours. Without a plan, you will be working far harder than you have to. A plan adds organization to your goal because it details specific actions and steps to get there.
<br>
Another reason to create a plan is that it will prevent your goal from becoming overwhelming. The temptation to feel overwhelmed is normal. Your plan will give you comfort and help you be successful. There is no right or wrong way to plan. Your plan can be formal and long, or uncomplicated and short. Here's how to create one: Take your career goal and break it into smaller pieces. Get out your calendar and write down the specific small pieces you will do and when you will do them. Tweak and make changes as you implement your plan. Use your plan to encourage and guide you. After all, your plan's underlying goal is for you to have an exceptional year.
<br>
Look At Your Goal Every Day
<br>
Most people want a "do-over" or a second chance. You get this opportunity on January 1st. If you create your goal, and then put it away, your words will have no value. What you can't see will soon be forgotten as the year progresses. When you look at your goal regularly, it gradually becomes a part of who you are.
<br>
Look at your goal every morning so you can start your day with focus. Look at your goal every evening, so that it stays with you in your dreams. Looking at your goal, and contemplating it, plays a large role in making it real.
<br>
So, what do you say? You only have one life to live, so it might as well be a life you love!
