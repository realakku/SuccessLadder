Investing in employee development during economicallychallenging times may not seem to be a good idea but HR experts think otherwise. The new league of corporate houses is for investing in human capital and believes it to be a critical aspect of the company’s success.<br><br>
 
They are also looking at boosting the skill sets of employees and are building a roadmap to successfully implement these changes. But is it really worthwhile to invest in the human capital? Speakers at the 25th HT Shine HR Conclave, the Navi Mumbai Chapter, had some interesting insights to share.
 <br><br>
Indranil Chakraborty, founder, StoryWorks, initiated the discussion by inviting the speakers to express their thoughts on how companies can look for more ways to invest on employees. Ashutosh Telang, chief human resource officer, Marico, said, “Companies who are looking at attracting and retaining top talent should necessarily focus on employee investment.”

Anant Pillai, executive vice president and chief learning officer, Reliance Industries, portrayed a different picture, “Not every investment needs to have a monetary value. A CEO mentoring a junior executive is also a way of employee investment.”

“Another important dimension is to have better workplaces where employees are also entitled to corporate wellness programmes,” added Rajkamal Vempati , head - HR ICICI Lombard. “There should be a focus on improving employee engagement and aligning their goals with organisational strategy,” said Alain Souny, India HR head-group HRIS director, Technip India.
