<tr bgcolor="#00ccff" align="center"><td><font color="#003366">On the domestic front, a lethargic atmosphere of legislative, administrative, and bureaucratic paralysis gave way to a pro-active public culture of accomplishment and accountability. Internationally, foreign relations with the US, a key trade partner that had plummeted to rock-bottom after the poorly-handled diplomatic incident of an Indian Foreign Service officer in January, soared culminating in the US President accepting the invitation to be the chief guest at the 65th Republic Day celebrations in 2015.<br><br>

 

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister’s excursions abroad managed to not only capture the world’s attention but created a pipeline of foreign capital worth billions of dollars into domestic manufacturing. Mr. Modi, in the process, has smoothly transitioned from the Bharatiya Janata Party’s star campaigner and orator to India’s internationally-acclaimed brand ambassador even as he cemented his reputation as an effective statesman at home.<br>

On the economic front, there have been equally positive developments, albeit largely due to exogenous factors. Within a year, the price of crude oil in the Indian basket has fallen by over 40 per cent from US $108.72 per barrel to US$60.58 per barrel in December easing off pressures on the twin deficits. With a continuing downward price trend, monthly oil imports have started falling since October and eased pressures off the trade deficit.

It has also made the ambitious-looking fiscal deficit target of 4.1 percent of GDP more achievable due to an estimated fuel subsidy savings of almost US $1.7 billion aided by policy measures resulting in food subsidy savings and lower spending on welfare programs through greater efficiency.

 <br><br>

Meanwhile, the easing of global commodity prices has reduced inflationary pressures; the consumer price inflation has nearly halved from 9.9 percent in December last year to 5.5 percent in October while the wholesale price index inflation has softened to 1.8 percent from 5.1 percent during the same period. Most importantly, the economy seems to have bottomed out with GDP growing at above 5 percent for three consecutive quarters. Indications of green shoots rising from better consumer and business sentiments signal even better times to come in future. It is quite likely that in a few years’ time, 2014 will be marked as the landmark year when things began to take a definite turn for the better for India.

Structural reforms addressing inefficiencies in the fields of energy, agriculture, labor market, taxation, and welfare schemes, will further unshackle the potential of the Indian economy. In particular, Prime Minister Modi’s focus on fast-tracking infrastructure development and energy security will ensure that roads, solar energy, smart cities, and other infrastructure segments see a larger inflow of investments. The uptrend in investor interest is also palpable amongst foreign investors with significant commitments from countries such as Japan and China across a wide range of established and emerging industries. While speed is of the essence for the Government to capitalize on its goodwill, years of bureaucratic neglect cannot be reversed overnight and it will take time for the Government to work through the backlog and bring in a coherent friendly framework for investors.
<br><br>


In the final analysis, India is not completely out of woods and it is imperative that the reform agenda is consistently followed. The Modi wave is leading to tectonic changes in the Indian political economy and the rise of new alliances is unlikely to be a smooth one. Against this background, the ruling coalition’s minority in the Upper House will hinder legislative reforms - the Insurance (Amendment) Bill and the Apprentices (Amendment) Bill were examples of this resistance in 2014. This will require the Government to seriously negotiate and adopt a non-confrontational approach with an opposition battling to save its turf.<br><br>
