<br>
Seven years ago, I had a job in the corporate world. I had an office, a good salary, and the privilege of being known and respected for consistently doing a job well done. Even though I was successful, I'd been unhappy in my career for years. I stayed put because I was comfortable, tied to the money, loved the adrenaline rush that deadlines produce, and enjoyed the compliments I received from my boss and peers.Secretly, I was building a business on the side. I was coaching people to live their dreams in the evenings and weekends. Although my clients were living lives they loved, I couldn't say I was doing the same.
<br>
Then, I got laid off. I was devastated, confused, and I felt betrayed. But I was one of many who were worried and wondering which direction to take next. Little did I know at the time, that this was the day I became a full time coach.
<br>
Today, I have a thriving coaching practice. I have never been happier. I owe my success to being able to imagine myself successful, visualizing victory in the future.
<br>
What I have learned can apply to you. Whether you have been searching for a job and it seems hopeless, or you are working and are tired, stressed, and barely keeping up with the workload. Start with the steps below.
<br>
Imagine yourself a year from now. The economy is picking up nicely. Although the previous year was tough for you, it was well worth it, because today you are enjoying your career tremendously. You are grateful for what transpired over the past year.
<br>
It took you a while to find your way, but you have arrived. You battled fear, uncertainty, and yourself. But you have come out a winner. Looking back, you see that there were five key steps that were your crucial to your success. They were:
<br>
You Accepted Where You Were
<br>
You stopped blaming the world for your predicament. You decided to forgive those who caused your situation. Most importantly, you forgave yourself. You acknowledged where you were because you knew that a better tomorrow would not happen until you accepted today.
<br>
You Decided You Would Win
<br>
You realized that you worked too hard to get where you were in your career, and you were not about to lose it all now. You decided that your present situation would not get the best of you. You let go of the shoulds, and the reasons why you couldn't have what you wanted in your career. Then, you made a plan to go after what you truly deserved.
<br>
You Persevered
<br>
You had a vision in your mind, and you did not give up. Sure, there were obstacles. But, you woke up each morning and told yourself that today was a brand new day. You made phone calls you were afraid to make. You wrote e-mail's and letters you weren't sure would get read. You networked. But most importantly, you were afraid, and you moved forward anyway.
<br>
You Asked For Help
<br>
This was a big deal for you because you were used to doing things on your own. You opened yourself up and asked for what you needed. You were surprised and appreciative because people from unexpected places took the time to help you. The best thing you learned is that life is much easier when you are not reaching your goals alone.
<br>
You Knew You Would End Up In A Better Place
<br>
You stopped driving yourself crazy because you knew things would improve. You recognized that your situation was only temporary. As a result, you enjoyed yourself more. You spent time getting to know you again. You lost weight, or took up a new hobby. You tried new things, and you grew in ways you never imagined possible. You are so much stronger and wiser now. You are not the same.
<br>
Ok. Now, it is today again. Do you want what saw? What steps specifically will you take to make it happen? Write it down. Look at it everyday. You have a bright future ahead of you once you can visualize the end result.
<br>
So, what do you say? You only have one life to live, so it might as well be a life you love!
