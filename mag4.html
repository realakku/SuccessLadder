While business sentiment may seem positive, companies may wait for the sentiment to turn into actual results before giving out substantial salary hikes in 2015. Consulting firm Mercer in its All Industries Total Remuneration Survey, says salary hikes in 2015 will not be much higher than what companies saw in 2014. The survey has forecast an increase of 11% for 2015 across industries and career levels.<br><br><br>

 

That compares with a 10.6% salary hike in 2014. Among the industries surveyed, the projected salary increase for the medical life sciences sector is the highest at 12% for 2015, while salaries for technology, information technology and IT enabled services (IT and ITes) is expected to see the lowest hikes at 10%. “While the salary increase forecasts are lowest for the IT and ITes, demand for emerging technologies in the areas of mobility computing and analytics will continue to command a premium,” said Shanthi Naresh, India business leader – information solutions, Mercer.

Consumer goods may see a salary increase of 11% on the back of increase in consumer demand; the chemical and automotive sectors have projected a salary increase of 10.8% and 10.1%, respectively. Naresh added that even as companies are forecasting a lower than average overall salary increase, managers are using their discretion to differentiate and reward high performers with slightly higher pay increases in order to aid retention.

As for hiring, 64% respondents indicated aggressive recruiting for new positions and for filling up positions due to attrition in the next 12 months. The technology, medical life sciences and IT and ITes sectors are most aggressive with regard to hiring projections for 2015.
