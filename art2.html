<br>
If you work long enough, something along the way will probably happen to you. You will work with a co-worker who drives you crazy, a boss that doesn't get you, or an employee that keeps you up at night.
<br>
It's all a part of the working world.At other times, things will happen to you that will throw you for a loop. Your job is eliminated. You are fired without reason. Your industry goes away. This is when it's important to take stock in who are you, what you want out of life, and where you want to go next.
<br>
So, how do you get yourself back on track; find your passion and purpose again, and reinvent the next phase of your career? You soul-search and ask lots of questions.
<br>
Here where you begin:
<br>
You Make Time To Think
<br>
Reinvention cannot happen without thought.
<br>
A clear picture of where you want to go next cannot come to you unless you create time to think about it. This time is what will allow you to get in touch with yourself and your priorities.
<br>
One of the main reasons your off track right now, is because you've been "busy," too busy to make time for you. This does not mean that you have to allocate days or weeks of thought to nothing else; BUT regularly taking an hour here and there will make a tremendous difference.
<br>
Ask yourself, "When will I make time to think about what I want?" Notice that I am not saying to ask yourself whether you will find time, but rather when you will make the time. It is essential to be assertive with yourself.
<br>
Once you have made the time, find a quiet place. Sit down and take deep breaths, as many as you need to instill a sense of calmness. Your mind will want to wander, but you must bring yourself back. Remind yourself why you are doing this. You want something better in your career. Focus on the importance of this to your career, and channel your thoughts in this direction.
<br>
You Ask Yourself What You Want
<br>
Reinvention happens when you decide what you want, and then take action to get it. Without an end in mind, you will wander aimlessly; and as long as you are aimless, you will be wasting time. You will feel lost. You will be like a stray leaf, going wherever the wind takes you.
<br>
Ask yourself the following questions:
<br>
    If it was impossible to fail, what would be different in my career?
    <br>What type of job would I have?
    <br>What would I be responsible for?
    <br>What type of boss/co-workers/team would I have?
    <br>What kind of hours would I work?
    <br>What type of company would I work for?
    <br>What sort of culture would the company have?
    <br>What city would I live in?
    <br>How much money would I make?
    <br>How would I handle stress, my workload, and deadlines?
    <br>How would I successfully be balancing work and life? 
<br>
There is no right or wrong answers to these questions. The answers are what are true for you-not what someone else wants for you, but what is in your heart. Listen to yourself, and your answers will be the perfect ones for you.
<br>
In addition, don't let past mistakes or choices cloud your answers. It's not too late for you.
<br>
You Turn What You Want Into A Vision For Your Career
<br>
A vision is a picture of where you see yourself in the future. Your picture can describe where you want to be in a day, a week, a month, a year, or even farther into the future.
<br>
All goals are reached in the mind first. You see yourself both achieving that goal and experiencing the satisfaction it will bring you once you are there. This picture is what will help you to persevere during times of doubt. It will help you with your reinvention. Your picture will give you purpose, power, and excitement. Your picture will give you a reason to get out of bed every day.
<br>
Here's an example of a vision:
<br>
I will have a career that energizes me. I will work for a company that cares about its people and be responsible for projects that make a difference. I will be paid well for my contributions. I will have a great relationship with my boss, co-workers, and staff, and work with supportive people. I will work in a location with plenty of sunshine, for no more than eight hours a day. I will commute no more than a half-hour each way. I will feel calm when everyone around me is stressed and I will wake up every morning looking forward to the day.
<br>
Remember, reinvention is a journey. One day you may have no idea who you are anymore, and on another day, you will be grateful for the events that have transpired in your life because you have become a person you truly love.
<br>
So, what do you say? You only have one life to live, so it might as well be a life you love!
