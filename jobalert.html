With close to 100,000+ of profiles being registered everyday on job portals, only about 2000+ get called by the recruiters; it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate your profile from others when it comes to job search. Here are some 10 smart tips to help you increase your chances of being called in by the recruiter and improve the quality of your free job alerts.
 <br><br>
<b>1. Register your profile on all the good job portals.</b><br>
Job portals save effort and time, and are more efficient than any other job search medium. All job portals send free job alerts based on your skill match with the job requirement. You can then send in your job applications, as well as keep a track of your online activities. Some of the top job portals in India are shine.com, monster.com, naukri.com amongst others.
 <br><br>
<b>2. Be active on your profile to get more free jobs alerts.</b><br>
Free job alerts would increase by 3 to 30 times if you’re among the active database job seekers. So logging into your profile and keeping it updated is very essential. Example – Update your profile every two days. Recruiters search candidates based on Functional Area, Education, Current Salary, Keywords, Skills, Designation, Company name, etc. This means there are multiple ways in which your Resume can show up in front of a recruiter. So, the more information you enter in your profile the more the chances that your resume shows up.
 <br><br>
<b>3. Verify your email id and phone number through SMS and Email.</b><br>
Always keep your email and phone numbers updated and verified as they are the only source of medium through which recruiter would get in touch with you. Job portals give more than 50% weightage to verified candidates.
 <br><br>
<b>4.Always remember to mention your current / latest annual salary –</b><br>
Keeping your salary updated on job portals will give you an edge on people who do not update their salaries. As many recruiters have salaries as a search criteria.
 <br><br>
<b>5. Right keywords in your Resume–</b><br>
One common resume blunder is failing to include searchable keywords that correspond to the job seeker’s skills and desired position. Keywords are the lifeline of the resume. Recruiters and employers often search for candidates on Internet job portals and social media platforms. And if you hand out hard-copy resumes, the use of keywords makes it easier for employers to quickly scan your resume and immediately determine if they should spend more time considering you.  Studies show that chances of recruitment increases by 40% with right keywords.<br><br>
 
<b>6. Highlighting your Skills-</b><br>
A recruiter will skim through the summary and key skills before deciding to delve further into employment details. So make sure you catch his/her attention. Focus on bringing out skills in your resume and you will notice greater success in capturing recruiters’ attention and job vacancies than by merely sharing work history. This is sure to get you good job alerts.
 <br><br>
<b>7. Featured Profile Services.</b><br>
These days mostly all job portals have a paid service which provides you with the benefit of getting higher up in the recruiter search thus giving you more job alerts opportunities. These services could be very useful for people looking for a quick job change. (Featured Profile on Shine.com)<br><br>
 
<b>8. Get a Perfect Resume writer by the Expert</b><br>
The internet provides you lot of sample profiles for reference, however, each resume has a different story and is unique. You wouldn’t want to miss out on good opportunities in spite of following the above 7 tips for the lack of good resume. Recruiters don’t spend more than 6 seconds in scanning a good resume and can easily make out the difference between a resume made out of a format versus a well written resume. We recommend a resume written by an expert, as an expert analyses every minute detail, understands the relevant keywords and place the right thing at the right place. A counselling session with the expert helps in getting valuable tips for job search. (Check Paid Resume Writing Services )

<b>9. Connect on LinkedIn</b><br>
Digitization has transformed the networking style. LinkedIn connects you with various professionals from various domains without any geographic boundary.

<b>10. Be true and keep searching</b><br>
It is always advised to mention the true information in the resume. A false statement in your profile can land you in no man’s world, plus, credibility is spoiled. To get a dream job, you need to keep on searching more and more using various tools - web site search, social connectivity, references, etc.
