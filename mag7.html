Hiring companies expect candidates to have a fair understanding of the job profile and things like company profile, culture etc. As such, investing time to research about the company and the job you have applied for has become more important than ever.
<br><br><br>
 

A proper research not only helps you be better prepared for interviews but also helps you decide whether you are fit for the job or not and avoids frustration that may happen if you find out later that you do not like the job. A smart search on Google can yield you good results. Here is what you should be researching for:
<br><br>
 

    <b>Company website:</b> This is the most reliable source of information about a company. You can find a lot of details about the company like the work culture, environment, work hours, top management, turnover etc. A few company websites also contain information about the various job profiles and the related roles and responsibilities.
<br><br>
 

    <b>Corporate blogs:</b> Blogs have become quite popular in the corporate world and as such, you can see a lot of companies launching their own blog sites. You can find a lot of information about the work culture, job openings, latest happenings, employee opinions etc. on the company blogs.

 <br><br><br>

    <b>Professional associations:</b> You can easily leverage your professional association membership to find out more about the company you have applied to. You can check the association website to get information about the company. If the company happens to be in the same industry that the association works in, you may also meet people working there and get the required information.
<br><br><br>
 

    <b>Discussion boards:</b> There are a lot of online professional discussion boards where people from different companies come together to help each other. You can go through these discussion boards to see if there are threads that talks about the company or job profile you need information on. You can also start your own thread and ask people to give their opinions. If you are lucky, you may get answers from the people working in the same company.<br><br><br>

 

 <b>   Talk to current employees:</b> What could be better than getting the required information from the current employees who know the company inside out? Take some time out to find out people who work with the organisation and talk to them to get the information you require. But be careful about the information you intake because there will always be dissatisfied employees who may paint a wrong picture in front of you.
<br><br>

Research well, get your basics right and see how your knowledge takes you places!
