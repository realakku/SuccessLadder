<tr><td><h1 align="center"><i>TEACHER</i></h1><br><b>Introduction</b><br>
A nation's prosperity is linked to good teachers. Our country has always respected this noble profession and has held the teachers in high esteem, almost next to God. Once Kabir wrote..
<br><i>
Guru govind daau khade, kaake laagun paun<br>
Balihaari main guru aapke jin govind diyo milaye</i><br> 
It means that a true teacher helps to awaken our inner being and takes us to that level from where we can see God.<br>

Guru or teacher literally means one who takes us out from darkness and brings us to light Gu (means darkness and Ru (means light)<br>

In recent years the focus of Indian Education System has been on Education for All so much of the stress has been laid on literacy, adult education, extension education and distance education programmes. But there is yawning gap between pedagogic progress and actual translation. So this leaves much scope for those who aspire to be teachers and prove themselves. Those who want to pursue this noble profession and get the satisfaction of dispelling the clouds of ignorance in other human beings can opt for teaching. Moreover education is being regarded as a growing industry and a big business. One can earn pretty well in this field along with enjoying many fringe benefits. Another reason for opting teacher as a career could be interest in the subject, secure professional career and regular annual vacations. It can also be a second career for those who have retired from professional services.
<br>
<b>Nature of Work</b><br>
The work of a teacher varies according to the level of the job and the institution. Nursery level and kindergarten level: The teacher is responsible for social, emotional and intellectual growth of the children. They introduce children to basic science, numbers and languages and train them to use their hands and co-ordinate their limb movement, develop their natural talents by engaging them in sing-along rhymes, help in handling educational toys and material for painting, drawing, music and clay modelling.<br>

<b>Junior School level:</b> The teachers instruct students between the age groups of 7 to 12 from class 1 to class 7. These teachers take classes almost for every subject.
<br>
<b>Secondary School level:</b> The secondary school teachers instruct students from 8th to 12th standard. Usually they deal with one particular subject in which they specialise. In addition to the subject they teach they have to take the responsibility of framing of school education programs and have to look after extra curricular activities like sports, drama and school outings. They have to interact with parents in school faculty meetings, prepare lesson plans, help students in their project work, prepare and correct test assignments etc
<br>
<b>College and University level:</b> In universities or colleges there are lecturers and professors who specialise in a particular field. They give lectures, guidance and help the students in their academic and research work. Those who have organising ability have a further scope to become a principal, vice-chancellor in the management level.
<br>
<b>Special schools:</b> A challenging area in the field of teaching is that of dealing with children having physical and mental handicap and learning disabilities. The work is emotionally and physically demanding which needs a lot of patience. They have to work in close association with parents and medical professionals like speech therapist physiotherapist etc. It is different from the normal teaching norms as each child needs special care depending on his/her disability. This work is emotionally and physically demanding therefore specialized training and skill is needed here to deal with specific problem.<br>

<b>Academic Administrator:</b> Management College, school and university administrators such as Principals, Vice Chancellors and Members on the Board of Management branch off from teaching to become administrators. It includes planning of time tables, organising activities and interacting with parents and authorities.<br>
<b>
Personality</b><br>
A good teacher is one who teaches to comprehend rather than mug up studies, one who imbibes values to last long in life, one who escapes the monotonous drill of text books and brings in excitement while teaching and learning, one who hold attention of the class of almost 50 students, for over 45 minutes each day in and day out!<br>

One should have a bend of mind towards teaching, patience, confidence, above average intelligence and liking for and an understanding of children which is a must. One must have an organizing capacity, friendly and helpful nature to enter into this field. Teacher should have the ability to communicate well, to create a liking in young minds even in the case of most boring subjects. She/he should have a deep passion for the subject one handles. Must encourage in students the ability to analyse and think. A teacher must always remember that apart from teaching it is he/she who shapes a child's character. Teacher has to be a friend, philosopher and guide to his wards.
