It was another noisy Thursday in frog world. <br>
A group of young frogs were chatting, discussing the latest news. As they looked at the nearby TV tower, the city' tallest structure, they thought how wonderful it would be to be able to climb on top of it, and go where no frog had ever been. "The wind, the view &hellip oh, to be on top of the tower!"said one of the frogs, and the others croaked in agreement. <br>

AS I waited at the doctor's clinic last week, a framed cartoon on the wall caught my attention. It illustrated a patient telling his doctor, angrily: "Don't talk to me about improving my diet. I ate a carrot last week, and nothing happened!"<br>

<b><h3>5.Life lessons from a baby giraffe</h3></b><br>

BABY giraffes never go to school. But they learn a very important lesson rather early in life. A lesson that all of us would do well to remember.<br> 
The birth of a baby giraffe is quite an earth-shaking event.  The baby falls from its mother?s womb, some eight feet above the ground. It shrivels up and lies still, too weak to move.
