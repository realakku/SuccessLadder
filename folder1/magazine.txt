Active, empathetic, educated listening. Great leaders persuade others to move in a certain direction by coaching and by listening to others' reasoning. Active and empathetic listening is vital. Leaders earn the trust, support, and confidence of people by listening to them. By giving employees the chance to express their ideas, leaders enhance support for change.
